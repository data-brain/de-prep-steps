# The Command Line

## 1

- Use the command `echo` to print a message `hello lewis` to the terminal.

## 2

- Print your current working directory to the terminal.

## 3

- Change directory back to your home directory if you’re not already there. Then, use `mkdir` to create a new directory called `northcoders`.

## 4

- Change directory into the `northcoders` directory. Print your current working directory again, always double checking where you are.

## 5

- Create some directories inside northcoders called `fundamentals`, `prep-steps`, `data`, `toolkit`, `ai_ml` and `project`.

- List all the directory contents of `northcoders` - you should be able to see the 5 directories you’ve just created.

## 6

- Change directory into your `fundamentals` directory.

## 7

- Create a new blank file in your `fundamentals` directory called `questions.txt`.

- Look up the commands to do this if you need to. You can find some [good documentation online here](https://oliverelliott.org/post/commandline/).

## 8

- Use the `cd ..` command in your terminal.

- Now, print your current working directory to work out where you are.

- What is happening when you run the command `cd ..`?

> Bonus: what about when you run `cd ...`?

## 9

- Run the `man ls` command in your terminal.

- Scroll down through this manual to try and figure out what the difference is between `-a` and `-A` as additions to the command `ls`.

- Now, run the commands `ls -a` and `ls -A` in your home directory.

## 10

- Try navigating to your home directory and then run the command `ls -a` again, but channel the output of this command into a text file called `directory-contents.txt`. Remember, you’ll need to use the re-direct operator `>` to complete this task.

- Now, use another command to read the contents of the `directory-contents.txt` file to check your work.
